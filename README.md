# scheduler

## Purpose
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day between 9AM - 5PM. The current day is displayed at the top of the page, and there are time blocks for each hour. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), in the present (red), or in the future (green). When you click on a time block, you can enter an event. When you click the save button, the information is stored in local storage and will persist on the page. The page is media responsive is well.
